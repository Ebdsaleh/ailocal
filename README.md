AI LOCAL: A chatbot project, for learning and tinkering with AI models and concepts. Currently you can create a user profile instance and an Ai profile instance to converse with. All the config files are stock from when I downloaded them from hugging face. The profiles for the user and Ai's are not uploaded here they will be created on first run. Program entry point is main.py, Ai Models are not included due to github's default LSF limitations.

Baby steps, savour the process.
